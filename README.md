# ML Final Project

This repository contains the code and the final written report for an ML/NLP final project.  
The first four files are the notebooks used to produce results discussed in the report, and the last file is the report PDF.

## Repository contents

- `ML_Final_Project_Supervised_Learning_BERT.ipynb`  
  Supervised learning using a BERT-style transformer model (fine-tuning / evaluation).

- `ML_Final_Project_Supervised_Learning_Bi-LSTM.ipynb`  
  Supervised learning using a Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) neural network baseline.

- `ML_Final_Project_Supervised_Learning_Liner_*.ipynb`  
  Supervised learning using a **linear model baseline** (e.g., TF-IDF + Logistic Regression / Linear SVM).  
  *(Filename includes “Liner/Linear”; open the notebook to see the exact approach.)*

- `ML_Final_Project_Unsupervised_Learning.ipynb`  
  Unsupervised learning notebook (e.g., clustering/topic modeling/embedding exploration) used for analysis in the report.

- `Report.pdf`  
  Final project report (methods, experiments, results, discussion).
