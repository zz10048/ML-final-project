# ML Final Project

This repository contains the code and the final written report for an ML/NLP final project.  
The first four files are the notebooks used to produce results discussed in the report, and the last file is the report PDF.

# Group members

Xingchen Liu, Mengqi Jia, Xin He, Zack Zang

Zack Zang：Designed and conducted the unsupervised learning component, performed exploratory analysis and visualization, and summarized insights in the report.

Xin He: Project idea formulation; Twitter API–based data collection; data preprocessing; report writing (introduction and dataset description) and editing.

Mengqi Jia: Constructed the TF–IDF feature pipeline and trained the Logistic Regression classifier; developed the Bi-LSTM model, optimizing its architecture and assessing improvements gained through contextual sequence modeling.

Xingchen Liu: Implementation and fine-tuning of BERT models; supervised learning experiments and result comparison; attention and embedding visualization; report writing
